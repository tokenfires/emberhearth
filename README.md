# EmberHearth

**A secure, accessible, always-on personal AI assistant for macOS.**

> *The ever-present warmth at the heart of your home.*

## Vision

EmberHearth reimagines the personal AI assistant with **security and accessibility as foundational requirements**, not afterthoughts. The goal: a system your spouse, parent, or child could safely set up and use.

### The Dream Setup

```
Buy Mac Mini → Sign into iCloud → Install EmberHearth → Chat via iMessage
```

No API keys to manage. No Docker to understand. No threat models to contemplate. Just a helpful assistant that's always there, learns over time, and can't be weaponized against you.

---

## Why EmberHearth?

Current AI assistants fall into two camps:

| Consumer Assistants | Power User Assistants |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Easy setup | Complex setup |
| Safe (limited) | Severe security risks |
| Not very capable | Highly capable |
| Don't learn about you | Can learn and adapt |

**EmberHearth bridges this gap** — capable enough to be transformative, safe enough for non-technical users.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Security by Removal** — No shell execution. Structured operations that can't be misused.
2. **Secure by Default** — Safe with zero configuration. Capabilities require explicit consent.
3. **The Grandmother Test** — If grandma can't use it unsupervised, it's not ready.
4. **Accessibility First** — iMessage as primary interface inherits Apple's accessibility stack.
5. **Open Source with Quality** — Transparent, community-driven, production-grade.

## Status

**Phase: Planning / Research**

This project is in early development. We're currently:
- Researching macOS APIs and security primitives
- Exploring iMessage integration approaches
- Evaluating local model capabilities
- Documenting the architecture

See [docs/NEXT-STEPS.md](docs/NEXT-STEPS.md) for the roadmap.

## Building in Public

Development of EmberHearth will be streamed live on Twitch. Follow along as we explore, prototype, make mistakes, and (hopefully) build something useful.

Building in public means transparency about the process — the good, the bad, and the "why did I think that would work?" moments.
