# Claude Phase Instructions

Phase-specific instruction files for Claude Code sessions. The active phase is set in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) at the project root.

---

## How This Works

1. `CLAUDE.md` contains permanent instructions (principles, security, naming) and a pointer to the active phase doc
2. The active phase doc (this directory) contains everything specific to the current work mode
3. When a phase completes, its doc moves to `archive/` and the pointer updates

## Active Phase

See `CLAUDE.md` for the current active phase.
